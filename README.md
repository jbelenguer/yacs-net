# YACS.NET

Yet another communication system for .NET

## Motivation
It is not the first time that I needed a communication library to allow me:
- Communicate different nodes using TCP directly
- Simple to use
- Have some advanced features (like node discovery)

Either if you are developing a game, or your own IoT system, the only option out there is to actually write it yourself over the System.Net.Sockets library (TcpListener/TcpClient).

Since this is not the first time I find this issue, I decided to write one so I can reuse it in a couple of projects.
